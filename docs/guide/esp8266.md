# ESP8266 Device

A library for use with an ESP8266 device has been developed to act as an IoT device in a network. This library handles all of the protocols for you such as joining and discovery. The library only requires you to implement a few methods which determine the current status of a device as this will be unique to each product.

## Installation

To begin, clone the repo for the [ESP8266 library](https://github.com/decentralised-home-automation-protocol/DHAP-ESP8266).

Download and install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software).

Download and install the [Arduino ESP8266 filesystem uploader plugin](https://github.com/esp8266/arduino-esp8266fs-plugin) for the Arduino IDE. This plugin is requried to upload the device xml file ontop the ESP8266 device. The xml must be stored in a file called `layout.xml`

## Usage

Create a class which inherits from ``` Status ``` such as ``` DeviceStatus ``` in the example implementation found on the master branch. This class will handle the state of your IoT device and will therefore be unique to each device. 

The Status class contains several methods that must be overridden ```getStatus() ```, ```executeCommand() ```, ```getMaxLeaseLength() ``` and ```getMinUpdatePeriod() ```. This class also includes two helper methods ```getCommandId(char *command)``` and  ```getCommandData(char *command)``` which can be used to get the element ID and data from an incoming command.

The implementation of this class is up to you as it will depend on the functionality of your IoT device. For more information on how to structure status updates, see the [The status update packet](http://localhost:8081/DHAP-Documentation/reference/packet-types.html#status-update). Your `getStatus()` method, should not return a packet type or mac address as shown on the packet type documentation. These values will be added for you. Your `getStatus()` method only needs to return a string of comma seperated status values.


``` C
class DeviceStatus : public Status
{
public:
  String getStatus()
  {
    return "true,4,5,false,0";
  }

  void executeCommand(char* command)
  {
    String id = getCommandId(command);
    String data = getCommandData(command);

    Serial.printf("IotCommand: id: %s data: %s\n", id.c_str(), data.c_str());
  }

  int getMaxLeaseLength()
  {
    return 100000;
  }

  int getMinUpdatePeriod()
  {
    return 250;
  }
};
```

Instantiate a new instance of your new class in the arduino `setup()` method.

``` C
IoTDevice ioTDevice;
DeviceStatus *deviceStatus;

void setup()
{
  Serial.begin(115200);
  Serial.println();

  deviceStatus = new DeviceStatus();

  ioTDevice.setup(false, *deviceStatus);
}
```

Then in the arduino `loop()` method, call ioTDevice.commandRecieved() with an array buffer to store any incoming commands.

``` C
char iotCommand[255];

void loop()
{
  if (ioTDevice.commandRecieved(iotCommand))
  {
    deviceStatus->executeCommand(iotCommand);
  }
}
```

And that's it! all other protocols not unique to any specific device will be handled for you.

Remember to upload the devices layout xml using the file system uploader plugin into a file named `layout.xml` onto the esp8266.
